			<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The Challenge of this lab was to experiment with AJAX and JSON.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One of the main problems was that I had a hard time understanding what an API was and how to implement it. The Pokemon API had a lot of information to pull from and I didn't know what information to display on to the actual site I also forgot how to use buttons and display things by clicking buttons. I referenced my previous labs and managed to figure it out. I did spend several hours searching up what APIs were and what ids were and how to find it but in the end I stuck with the simple Yes/No API because I just could not figure it out. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Jessica really helped me understand what an API was but overall I severely struggled with this lab because I already had not much knowledge on Javascript or Jquery and suddenly we were doing something related to APIs and JSON which I still do not understand.</p>
