			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was receiving the directions and then having to figure out how to get to the end goal from there. As a person with no experience going into these assignments, it is a slow but steady process.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The first problem that arose was resizing the images I wanted to add in. With the help of my partner I was able to better understand what each of the file names meant which really helped me wrap my head around everything. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This assignment was easier than the last one since I built upon my foundation from the previous lab. Although it had more steps, I understood it better and it only took a few hours while the last one took more than 4 hours. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
