					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to modify the DOM.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My only problem was trying to change the color of the output because I was unsure whether that was supposed to be done in javascript or css. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Because we did a large portion of this lab in class, I was able to figure out how to do relatively quickly compared to other labs. By referencing Wes' website I was able to see what he did to make it work.  </p>
