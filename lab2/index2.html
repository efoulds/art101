            <p>I am working with Ichiro Sugimoto for this lab. We are cooperating well, and are managing to work through the lab. It is quite difficult in my opinion. He is working on the index.html, and I am working on the CSS file.</p>
            <p> I have no experience with coding so I am struggling to understand what I need to do to make things work. For some reason my CSS file was not linking properply before.
