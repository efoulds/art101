					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to write functions that take user input and also use javascript events to retrieve certain information</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I spent several hours trying to figure out how to get the user input to make itself into an anagram on the website. I managed to get the button to show up easily but from there I struggled because I did not know where to start in terms of what I had to have in HTML and what I had to have in Javascript to connect the two. It turns out that I had to change the id from username to name. I figured this out thanks to my partner.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall the lab incorporated elements from Lab 7 but it was challenging overall trying to retrieve certain information using divs and ids. I struggled a lot. </p>
