			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Since this lab required minimal coding it was not as challenging as previous labs. The main challenge of this lab was keeping track of exactly what steps needed to be taken for the lab. For example, reiterating information on this index.html and the doc was slightly confusing.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problem for this lab was that I had no partner. It did not get resolved. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>All in all, this lab was definitely doable by myself compared to other labs, however next time I will make sure to secure a partner. I put a significant amount of time and energy into this lab just because it was confusing and not hard.  </p>
