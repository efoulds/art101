			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge is to create a function that depends on conditionals.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Only one problem arose which was the way the text and button was formatted on the page and it was easily fixed by going back into the JS and fixig any spacing issues </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was not difficult because the expectations were clearly laid out and there was a perfect example in the directions, however I learned from this lab that by assigning words number values you can "randomly generate" things. It was a good learning experience. </p>
