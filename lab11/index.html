					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>jQuery is a completely new to me so it was difficult getting the hang of how to implement it into my website. I first put in the wrong div id which is why my button was not showing up. I mistook it for the class id. I also struggled with understanding how to use the same css for multiple classes to prevent having to redo the css for each section and my partner helped me with that. However it ended up not mattering since I wanted to change the css of each class anyway so the special class would override it using the button.</p>
					<div id="button2"></div>

			<div class="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was extremely time consuming and I put a lot of energy and effort into understanding classes and ids and how to use jQuery to get one class to override the other so the css showed up. Not only was getting the button to show up a challenge, from there getting the button to do certain things was difficult too and each step required multiple steps ranging over my index file, css file, and js file. It was difficult keeping track of everything so that they all linked properly.</p>
