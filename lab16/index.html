					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to work with APIs and JSON.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main issue was that I had no idea how to do any of what we were told to do. I was able to find the API end point and do the whole retrieve and get thing but after that I relied on chatGPT to help me figure out what to do. The first problem that occurred was that Wes' webpage would not show the output so I did not know what the result was supposed to look like. After that through communication with Gabriella, I learned that I needed to download a chrome extension. After that I was able to view Wes' webpage. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall this lab was time consuming and difficult but I managed to use chatGPT as a resource which I think will be extremely useful in the future. </p>
